  "Association list of rules what to do with windows.
Each rule consists of a condition and a property list.  The
condition can be a symbol, a string or t.  If it's a symbol,
match the buffer's major mode.  If it's a string, match the name
of the buffer.  Use the following option in the property list to
use regular expression matching:

:regexp and t

If the condition is t, turn the property list into the fallback
to use for every invocation of `display-buffer' with an unmatched
condition.

The property list accepts the following keys and values:

:select and t

Make sure the window that popped up is selected afterwards.
Customize `shackle-select-reused-windows' to make this the
default for windows already displaying the buffer.

:same and t

Don't pop up any window and reuse the currently active one.

:popup and t

Pop up a new window instead of reusing the current one.

:align and t or either of 'above, 'below, 'left and 'right

Align the popped up window at any of the specified sides or the
default size (see `shackle-default-alignment') by deleting all
other windows, then restore the window configuration after the
window has been \"dealt\" with by either burying its buffer or
deleting the window.

:ratio and a floating point value between 0 and 1

Use this option to specify a different ratio than the default
value of 0.5 (see `shackle-default-ratio').

:frame and t

Pop to a frame instead of window.

To make an exception to a fallback rule, use the condition you
want to exclude and either not use the key in question, use a
different value or use a placeholder as key."
